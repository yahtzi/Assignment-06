        <h2>Halo: Fall of Reach</h2>
        <h3>Eric Nylund | Del Rey</h3>
        <p>A space military science fiction novel, set int the Halo universe, acting 
            as a prequel to Halo:Combat evolved. Released in October 2001, events take place
            in the Halo universe, traveling faster than the speed of light is possible 
            through slipspace, another dimension where special relativity does not apply. 
            This has allowed humans to colonize hundreds of other planets which are 
            controlled by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Feeling repressed by the 
            UNSC's heavy-handed rule, some colonies revolt. Fearing rebellion will tear the UNSC 
            apart, military leaders approve the SPARTAN-II Program, a secret squad of super
            soldiers designed to quietly suppress rebellion.
