            <h2>Halo: Fall of Reach</h2>
            <h3>Eric Nylund | Del Rey</h3>
            <p class="synopsis">
                A space military science fiction novel, set int the Halo universe, acting 
                as a prequel to Halo:Combat evolved. Released in October 2001, events take place
                in the Halo universe, traveling faster than the speed of light is possible 
                through slipspace, another dimension where special relativity does not apply. 
                This has allowed humans to colonize hundreds of other planets which are 
                controlled by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). Feeling repressed by the 
                UNSC's heavy-handed rule, some colonies revolt. Fearing rebellion will tear the UNSC 
                apart, military leaders approve the SPARTAN-II Program, a secret squad of super
                soldiers designed to quietly suppress rebellion.

            <h2>A Child Called It</h2>
            <h3>Dave Pelzer | Deerfield Beach</h3>
            <p class="synopsis"> 
                A Child Called It, is an autobiography of a young boy who is starved, beaten, and
                tortured by his mother. David was beaten everyday as a child. He was skinny because he was 
                constantly deprived of food, and was forced to be the family's slave. As times passes, David's 
                punishments became more cruel and dangerous. David was forced to wear the same clothing each day, 
                which made him an outcast at school because he smelled bad. This was just one way his mother 
                humiliated him. David uses his courage and internal motivation to come out of the dark times and
                make a life for himself, which included a great deal of public speaking.
